run file cuda_test.py, e.g. "python cuda_test.py"

If the answer is "cuda" you are done. Enjoy training!

If the answer is "CPU" or "Torch not compiled with CUDA Support" the following steps are required:

1) Go to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and select the following configuration:

(Versions are shown as they were when writing this guide, you might need to adapt)

PyTorch Build: Stable (1.11.0)
Your OS: Windows
Package: Pip
Language: Python
Compute Platform: CUDA 11.3

Then copy the given command, which was the following when writing this document:

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113

===========================================
DO NOT INSTALL YET ! JUST SAVE THE COMMAND!
===========================================

2) Download & install the required CUDA Toolkit Version (11.3) from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive 
3) UNINSTALL the currently installed version of Torch: pip uninstall torch
4) Now execute the command from above to install pytorch with cuda support
5) re-run cuda_test.py
